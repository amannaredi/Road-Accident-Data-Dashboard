# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes road accident data to provide insights into various accident metrics. The dashboard includes analysis of accident trends, types, locations, and conditions, making it a valuable tool for understanding and improving road safety.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface to explore accident data with dynamic slicers and map visualizations.
- **Casualty Analysis**: Displays total casualties, including a breakdown of serious and slight casualties.
- **Vehicle Type Insights**: Highlights casualties based on different vehicle types like cars, bikes, and buses.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Offers insights into accidents by urban vs. rural areas and specific road types using map visualizations.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzes monthly trends in casualties to identify patterns over time.
- **Speed Limit Insights**: Speed limit analysis excluded from KPIs due to lack of significant trends, with most accidents occurring at 30 and 70 speed limits.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis includes detailed information about road accidents, such as:
- Accident type
- Vehicle type
- Casualty severity
- Geographical location (urban/rural)
