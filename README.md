# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes road accident data to provide insights into various accident metrics. The dashboard includes analysis of accident trends, types, locations, and conditions, making it a valuable tool for understanding and improving road safety.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface to explore accident data with dynamic slicers and map visualizations.
- **Casualty Analysis**: Displays total casualties, including a breakdown of serious and slight casualties.
- **Vehicle Type Insights**: Highlights casualties based on different vehicle types like cars, bikes, and buses.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Offers insights into accidents by urban vs. rural areas and specific road types using map visualizations.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzes monthly trends in casualties to identify patterns over time.
- **Speed Limit Insights**: Speed limit analysis excluded from KPIs due to lack of significant trends, with most accidents occurring at 30 and 70 speed limits.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis includes detailed information about road accidents, such as:
- Accident type
- Vehicle type
- Casualty severity
- Geographical location (urban/rural)
- Light conditions
- Road types

## Tech Stack
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Excel**: For data pre-processing and initial exploration.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.

## Dashboard Highlights
- **Total Casualties (CY)**: 195.7K, with a decrease of 11.9% from the previous year.
- **Total Accidents (CY)**: 144.4K, showing a reduction of 11.7%.
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Cars account for the majority of accidents, followed by bikes and vans.
- **Urban vs. Rural Accidents**: 61.95% of casualties occur in urban areas, while 38.05% are in rural areas.
- **Light Conditions**: 73.84% of accidents happen during the day, with the rest occurring in the dark.

## Installation & Usage
To view the dashboard, follow these steps:
1. Download the Power BI dashboard file (`Road_Accident_Analysis.pbix`).
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Interact with the dashboard by using the provided slicers and map visualizations to explore the data.

## Future Work
- Adding more detailed filters for deeper analysis, such as driver age and weather conditions.
- Integrating real-time data to monitor accident trends dynamically.
- Implementing predictive analytics to identify potential accident hotspots.
